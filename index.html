                <p>
		Assignment 1 was to create a schematic for at least 3 LEDs connected to your Arduino and to write firmware (in a .ino file) for the circuit that makes the LEDs blink in a pattern.

                <p>
		Assignment 2 was to create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses LEDs, a button, a for-loop, digitalWrite(), digitalRead(), and analogWrite().

                <p>
		Assignment 3 was to create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses a sensor (e.g. either the photoresistor or the thermistor) in a voltage divider to change the state of an LED.

                <p>
        Assignment 4 was to create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses a transistor to control load power separate from logic power.
