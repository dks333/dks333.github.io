                The schematic demonstrates how I accomplish making three LED blink sequentially. First, Connect<br> each LED to a separate Pin on Arduino. Second, add resistors to the circuit to drop the voltage on<br> 
                each LED to prevent LEDs from breaking. Finally, Connect the LEDs back to GND on Arduino.

            <p>
                In this assignment, I used blue, red, and white LEDs along with 220K resistors. The resistance of each LED is around 100 ohms. If only using the LED without any resistor, I would destroy the LED because the current flowing throught LED would be 5V/100 ohms = 0.05A which would not be good to the LED. If I used 220K resistors, the current flows through each LED would be around 5V/(100 + 220) ohms = 0.015A which is in the desired current range.

                 Each LED is blinking independently. By setting the delay time for switching on/off LED,<br>
                 LEDs blink sequentially. Every LED will blink 1/5 second in a loop.
